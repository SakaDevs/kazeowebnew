    "shortStory": "As the eldest son of Duke Baroque, Lancelot was born rebellious. Dead set on resisting the political marriage arranged for him by his father, he traveled the country and led a licentious life instead.

The prodigal son made a repentant return and thus began his adventure across the Land of Dawn.",
