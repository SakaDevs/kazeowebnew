    "shortStory": "Ling once belonged to the Finch Sect, a mysterious and feared order of assassins from the Cadia Riverlands. During a mission, he nearly lost his life but was saved by the Vermilion Bird; it was an encounter that would kindle his yearning for freedom. In a bargain to leave the Finch Sect, he undertook one last mission to infiltrate the Dragon Altar. It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

It was from them that he learned the existence of death. While confused by this sudden revelation, he was mistaken by the pandas for the deity of the mountain. In particular, a small panda named Li Li became infatuated with Sun and devoted his days to picking peaches for the Monkey King. But when a flash flood struck the panda village one day, Li Li was lost to the torrents while looking for peaches. Sun arrived too late, and despite the pleas of the other pandas, he did not have the ability to bring his friend back from the dead. It was then that Sun experienced loss for the first time. Unable to comprehend his grief, he fell into a deep slumber. Millennia passed, and many more would have passed by had Sun not been awakened by a battle between dragons. After slaying the Black Dragon and unknowingly saving the Cadia Riverlands, he asked the Silver Dragon about immortality and finding one's purpose. Instead of the answer he sought, the dragon gave him the name Sun and the task of being the guardian of the land. But what does that entail? Sun was once again lost in though",

But unlike the countless times before, an exceptionally bright star could be seen this night. As Novaria gazed upon it, her hands reached out as if by instinct, until it was stopped by an invisible cage. Of course they wouldn't allow it. Novaria knew that all too well. This night, and every night, the stars held her prisoner. She could only watch the tiny glimmers overhead and ruminate the story of her life over and over again.",

She's the 'daughter of Eruditio', just like a bright star that shines over the streets of Eruditio in the darkness of night. Brave and selfless, she always had a bright and happy smile on her face while toting the gun handed to her by her grandfather, protecting Eruditio in her own way. As a child, Layla would always ask her grandfather about her parents, but his reluctance to tell her and his sad face told her it was something tragic. Because of that, Layla decided to never pain her grandfather anymore, so she stopped pursuing the matter. However, as secrets cannot be hidden forever, the truth of her birth eventually surfaced, and it turns out that her parents have always been watching her from the skies—well, in the literal sense.",

At last, Kagura understood: though born from lingering attachments, her path led toward freedom. She would carry both the regrets and hopes of those who had passed to experience the beauty of the mortal realm they were never able to, and embrace the future they were robbed of yet graciously bestowed upon her.",

To preserve the delicate balance of power between the Shadow and Scarlet Sects, Hayabusa willingly took his brother's place to be a political pawn and hostage, to be raised within the rival Scarlet Sect. Every day spent in the Scarlet Sect, Hayabusa lived by his brother's principles. He mastered his unique Shadow Shuriken technique and forged an unbreakable bond with Hanabi, a kunoichi of the Scarlet Sect. But when Hanzo's betrayal and his brother's disappearance shattered their hopes for peace, Hayabusa realized that the moonlight that had always guided him was gone. Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

    "shortStory": "Among the four renowned members of Forsaken Light, one young man from the East stands out. Known as Yin, this simple and righteous martial artist sometimes exudes a sinister aura, creating a stark contrast that leaves many wary of him. Few know that his wild and violent behavior stems from the Evil God, Lieh, dwelling within him. He is the reason Yin left his home in the Cadia Riverlands—to hone himself in the Land of Dawn and find a way to defeat Lieh. But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this power—because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh. Yin never backs down from a challenge, god or no god.",

During a mission, he nearly lost his life but was saved by the Vermilion Bird; it was an encounter that would kindle his yearning for freedom. In a bargain to leave the Finch Sect, he undertook one last mission to infiltrate the Dragon Altar. It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",
