She's the 'daughter of Eruditio', just like a bright star that shines over the streets of Eruditio in the darkness of night. Brave and selfless, she always had a bright and happy smile on her face while toting the gun handed to her by her grandfather, protecting Eruditio in her own way. As a child, Layla would always ask her grandfather about her parents, but his reluctance to tell her and his sad face told her it was something tragic. Because of that, Layla decided to never pain her grandfather anymore, so she stopped pursuing the matter. However, as secrets cannot be hidden forever, the truth of her birth eventually surfaced, and it turns out that her parents have always been watching her from the skies—well, in the literal sense.",
