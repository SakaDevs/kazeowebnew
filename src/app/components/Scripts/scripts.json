However, he was defeated by his senior brother, Baxia, and left to die in the mountains. After ten years of arduous training and travel, Yu Zhong found himself back at the Dragon Altar. He faced off against the Oriental Fighters, broke the seal to the Reverse Scale, and clashed in a final battle with the Evil God, Lieh, who caused the demise of the previous Black Dragon.

When she opened her umbrella in contemplation, she beheld not gentle rain but visions of calamity, eternities of regret, and a past seen through her umbrella. At last, Kagura understood: though born from lingering attachments, her path led toward freedom. She would carry both the regrets and hopes of those who had passed to experience the beauty of the mortal realm they were never able to, and embrace the future they were robbed of yet graciously bestowed upon her.",

Every day spent in the Scarlet Sect, Hayabusa lived by his brother's principles. He mastered his unique Shadow Shuriken technique and forged an unbreakable bond with Hanabi, a kunoichi of the Scarlet Sect. But when Hanzo's betrayal and his brother's disappearance shattered their hopes for peace, Hayabusa realized that the moonlight that had always guided him was gone. Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it isâ€”the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

    "shortStory": "Among the four renowned members of Forsaken Light, one young man from the East stands out. Known as Yin, this simple and righteous martial artist sometimes exudes a sinister aura, creating a stark contrast that leaves many wary of him. Few know that his wild and violent behavior stems from the Evil God, Lieh, dwelling within him. He is the reason Yin left his home in the Cadia Riverlandsâ€”to hone himself in the Land of Dawn and find a way to defeat Lieh. But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this powerâ€”because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh. Yin never backs down from a challenge, god or no god.",

    "shortStory": "Lukas is a recently revived from inside the Imperial Sanctuary. Endowed with a special bloodline that allows him to take human form, he was once befriended by Emperor Gaius and fought alongside him to create the glorious Moniyan Empire. After a millennium-long slumber, he was awakened by Silvanna and vowed to herald a new era for the Empire at her side. Beneath his brazen and rambunctious appearance lies a pure and earnest heart. For Lukas, fighting is not only his duty but the instinctive expression of his spirit. He firmly believes he will create something as brilliant as the dawning sun to illuminate every corner of the Moniyan Empire and rewrite the legend of the Beast of Light.",

During a mission, he nearly lost his life but was saved by the Vermilion Bird; it was an encounter that would kindle his yearning for freedom. In a bargain to leave the Finch Sect, he undertook one last mission to infiltrate the Dragon Altar. It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",
