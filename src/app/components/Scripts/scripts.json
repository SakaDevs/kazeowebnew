She's the 'daughter of Eruditio', just like a bright star that shines over the streets of Eruditio in the darkness of night. Brave and selfless, she always had a bright and happy smile on her face while toting the gun handed to her by her grandfather, protecting Eruditio in her own way. As a child, Layla would always ask her grandfather about her parents, but his reluctance to tell her and his sad face told her it was something tragic. Because of that, Layla decided to never pain her grandfather anymore, so she stopped pursuing the matter. However, as secrets cannot be hidden forever, the truth of her birth eventually surfaced, and it turns out that her parents have always been watching her from the skies—well, in the literal sense.",

When she opened her umbrella in contemplation, she beheld not gentle rain but visions of calamity, eternities of regret, and a past seen through her umbrella. At last, Kagura understood: though born from lingering attachments, her path led toward freedom. She would carry both the regrets and hopes of those who had passed to experience the beauty of the mortal realm they were never able to, and embrace the future they were robbed of yet graciously bestowed upon her.",

Every day spent in the Scarlet Sect, Hayabusa lived by his brother's principles. He mastered his unique Shadow Shuriken technique and forged an unbreakable bond with Hanabi, a kunoichi of the Scarlet Sect. But when Hanzo's betrayal and his brother's disappearance shattered their hopes for peace, Hayabusa realized that the moonlight that had always guided him was gone. Yet, he gripped his blade firmly, determined to forge ahead through the shadows, following his brother's nindo.",

But if someone could enter his world, they would realize how terrifying it is—the incessant howls and shrill cries constantly deafening his ears and heart. When he draws his demon-devouring weapons and unleashes a hail of bullets, the agonizing howls of demons become a requiem playing in the depths of his soul. Only the intertwining of their death shrieks and the sound of gunfire can drown out the noise that torments him daily. Each shot fired by Granger is not only his performance against the Abyss, but also an expression of his lament.",

Although, the Leonins never step foot outside of the Enchanted Forest, living a peaceful and safe life on their own. The Leonins became so complacent with their blissful existence that they no longer pursed the magic arts, a hallmark of their people. Harith became very discontent with this trend and confidently set out of the Enchanted Forest to see the outside world at the young age of 15.

    "shortStory": "Among the four renowned members of Forsaken Light, one young man from the East stands out. Known as Yin, this simple and righteous martial artist sometimes exudes a sinister aura, creating a stark contrast that leaves many wary of him. Few know that his wild and violent behavior stems from the Evil God, Lieh, dwelling within him. He is the reason Yin left his home in the Cadia Riverlands—to hone himself in the Land of Dawn and find a way to defeat Lieh. But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this power—because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh. Yin never backs down from a challenge, god or no god.",
