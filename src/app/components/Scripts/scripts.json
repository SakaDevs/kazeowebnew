    "shortStory": "Among the four renowned members of Forsaken Light, one young man from the East stands out. Known as Yin, this simple and righteous martial artist sometimes exudes a sinister aura, creating a stark contrast that leaves many wary of him. Few know that his wild and violent behavior stems from the Evil God, Lieh, dwelling within him. He is the reason Yin left his home in the Cadia Riverlands—to hone himself in the Land of Dawn and find a way to defeat Lieh. But Yin's struggles in this foreign land have had the opposite effect; as a being that thrives on chaos, the more Yin fights, the faster Lieh can recover his power. Thus, Lieh began to impart his power to Yin, watching him sink deeper into madness with each act of righteousness and chivalry, and leading him toward the self-destruction Lieh desires. However, even knowing the risks, Yin continues to wield this power—because for him, abandoning his code and ignoring the suffering of others would make him no better than Lieh. Yin never backs down from a challenge, god or no god.",

During a mission, he nearly lost his life but was saved by the Vermilion Bird; it was an encounter that would kindle his yearning for freedom. In a bargain to leave the Finch Sect, he undertook one last mission to infiltrate the Dragon Altar. It wasn't until he allied with Yu Zhong, the reincarnation of the Black Dragon, to break the seal of the Dragon Altar, that the spirit of the Vermilion Bird once again saved his life. Only then did he see the truth and understand the meaning of freedom. In this world, the Vermilion Bird had faded away, leaving only Ling, a young man with wings to soar freely among the clouds like the Cyan Finch.",
