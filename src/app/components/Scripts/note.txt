    "shortStory": "Once a valiant and fearless desert warrior, Moskov met his end on the battlefield against his rival Khaleed. But in death, his soul encountered a great vortex of darkness buried beneath the sand by the desert tyrant Khufra. For centuries, the Vortex incited discord among the desert tribes and harvested the dark energy borne from their bloodshed. Though the Vortex's insidious influence trapped the desert in a cycle of strife and anguish, the Vortex itself sought to be freed. Tempted with the promise of revenge, Moskov extracted the core of the vortex, the Spear of Quiescence, and was reborn in the power of the darkness. Now he roams the sands, seeking revenge upon Khufra in the name of the desert.",
